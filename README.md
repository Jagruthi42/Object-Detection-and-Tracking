# Object-Detection-and-Tracking
This project implements object detection and tracking using the MobileNet-SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) algorithm. The application is designed to identify and follow objects across video frames, leveraging the efficiency and speed of the MobileNet architecture for real-time performance.

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection:** Employs the efficient MobileNet-SSD model for fast and accurate detection.
- **Multiple Video Sources:** Supports processing both local video files and live webcam feeds.
- **Multi-Class Identification:** Capable of detecting 20 common object classes.
- **Simple GUI:** A straightforward interface built with Tkinter allows users to easily select their video source.

## How It Works

The application loads a pre-trained MobileNet-SSD Caffe model. When a user selects a video source (a file or webcam), the script reads the video frame by frame. Each frame is pre-processed into a blob and passed through the neural network. The model returns the detected objects, their locations, and a confidence score. Bounding boxes and class labels are then drawn on the frames for objects detected with a confidence score above a set threshold, and the resulting video is displayed in real-time.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

The necessary model files are included in the repository:
- `MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt.txt`
- `MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel`

### Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jagruthi42/Object-Detection-and-Tracking.git
    cd Object-Detection-and-Tracking
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the environment
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the `app.py` script from your terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

- In the application window, click **"Browse System Videos"** to select a video file from your computer.
- Click **"Start Webcam Video Tracking"** to use your live webcam feed as the source.
- While the video is playing, press the `q` key to stop the stream and close the video window.

## Files

- `app.py`: The main application script containing the GUI logic and object detection loop.
- `MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt.txt`: The architecture definition for the Caffe model.
- `MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel`: The pre-trained weights for the MobileNet-SSD model.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python packages required to run the project.
